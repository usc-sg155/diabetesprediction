# Diabetes Prediction Project

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes based on certain features using machine learning techniques. The predictive model has been developed and trained using Google Colab, and the notebook is available for further exploration.

## Project Structure

- **Notebook:** [Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb]
  - The primary notebook where the data exploration, model development, and evaluation take place.
  
- **Dataset:** [diabetes_dataset.csv]
  - The dataset used for training and testing the predictive model.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A Python environment with necessary libraries installed. You can find the required dependencies in the notebook.

**Usage**
Open the Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment or any compatible notebook viewer.

Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to explore the data, build the predictive model, and evaluate its performance.

**Results**
The primary objective is to predict whether a patient is diabetic or not.
The model has been trained to assign labels:
0: Not Diabetic
1: Diabetic
Provide insights into the model's performance, key findings, and any additional analysis conducted.
